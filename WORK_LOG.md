I just spent the last 20 or so minutes writing the corresponding code. It's looking good in my head, but I have no clue how it runs. |
| 2/25/25 |  8:00-9:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I finished up the code for my first idea, but when I test it, it only passes the correct small and the test tricky. What makes me think that I'm not on the right track is that if I switch the order that the texts are inputted to the program, the output of the substring is different. I think this is an issue due to the nature of the idea, so I'm going to attempt Sabrina's tabulation idea. |

I've been looking through the debugger to see where it goes wrong, but I'm still looking. |
| 2/27/25 | 9:45-10:30pm  | After going through the debugger over and over, I found two issues in my code. The first was that I had the checking for the edge case of incrementing a square that would cause it to be greater than the index was using the wrong comparison, but once I switched it, it was still showing 0. Finally I realized that I didn't have the bounds of the for loop accounting for the extra padding row and column, so it was stopping short of the array and the last row wasn't being filled. After I fixed this, I got a correct answer for small, but I'm over shooting all the other test cases by an amount proportional to their size. |

Unfortunately this makes it really hard to figure out why I'm over shooting the target. I tried changing a few small things in the code to see they effect they would have, but I can't figure it out right now. |
| 2.28.25 | 11:45-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yeah, I've decided the dots look cooler in the date soo.. Also I got it working! I had the algorithm slightly wrong, when the letters matched, I just added one to the same comparison, which was not accurate. It makes sense that it should add one to the diagonal square because that is the previous state of the strings, and if they're both equal, they will add one to the LCS. |
