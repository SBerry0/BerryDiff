I just spent the last 20 or so minutes writing the corresponding code. It's looking good in my head, but I have no clue how it runs. |
| 2/25/25 | 8:00-9:00pm | I finished up the code for my first idea, but when I test it, it only passes the correct small and the test tricky. What makes me think that I'm not on the right track is that if I switch the order that the texts are inputted to the program, the output of the substring is different. I think this is an issue due to the nature of the idea, so I'm going to attempt Sabrina's tabulation idea. |
